Based on the provided PHP class `EWP_Dynamic_Blocks`, which extends Gutenberg block functionality with dynamic registration and REST API extensions, I will create a README.md file content that outlines how developers can use the `ewp_gutenberg_blocks_filter` to add custom Gutenberg blocks through your plugin. The README will cover the basics of using the filter, expected block array structure, and a simple example.

# EWP Dynamic Blocks

EWP Dynamic Blocks provides a framework for dynamically registering custom Gutenberg blocks and corresponding REST API endpoints in WordPress. This allows developers to easily extend Gutenberg with custom functionality, ensuring a secure and optimized manner of block registration and usage.

## How to Add a Custom Block

To add a custom Gutenberg block using EWP Dynamic Blocks, you need to utilize the `ewp_gutenberg_blocks_filter` filter. This filter allows you to add your block specifications to the list of blocks that EWP Dynamic Blocks manages.

### Using `ewp_gutenberg_blocks_filter`

To register your custom blocks, attach them to the `ewp_gutenberg_blocks_filter` filter provided by the EWP Dynamic Blocks plugin. Here's the basic structure you should follow:

```php
function my_custom_blocks($blocks) {
    $blocks['my_custom_block'] = array(
        'namespace' => 'my-namespace',
        'name' => 'my-custom-block',
        'title' => __('My Custom Block', 'text-domain'),
        'description' => __('A description of what my custom block does.', 'text-domain'),
        'category' => 'common',
        'icon' => 'admin-site',
        'script'=>'',
        'style'=>'',
        'attributes' => array(
            // Define attributes here
        ),
        'render_callback' => 'my_custom_block_render_callback',
        'version' => '1.0.0',
        'dependencies' => array('wp-blocks', 'wp-element'), // Additional script dependencies
    );

    return $blocks;
}
add_filter('ewp_gutenberg_blocks_filter', 'my_custom_blocks');
```

### Block Array Structure

- `namespace` and `name`: Unique identifiers for your block.
- `title`: The display name of your block.
- `description`: A brief description of what your block does.
- `category`: The category under which your block should appear.
- `style`: The style to use in admin & frontend. You should use the name of th handle of the style.
- `script`: The script to use in admin & frontend. You should use the name of th handle of the script.
- `icon`: Dashicon to use as the block icon.
- `attributes`: An array of attributes your block uses. Each attribute should specify its type and default value. The array is based on the awm inputs array. You can either add a callback (name of a function) or a function.
- `render_callback`: The function name that will be called to render the block on the front end.
- `version`: The version of your block.
- `dependencies`: An array of script dependencies required by your block.

### Example

```php
function my_custom_block_render_callback($attributes) {
    // Render your block's HTML here
    return '<div class="my-custom-block">Hello, World!</div>';
}
```

This README provides a starting point for developers to integrate custom Gutenberg blocks into their WordPress site using the EWP Dynamic Blocks plugin. Remember to replace placeholders like `my_custom_blocks`, `my_custom_block_render_callback`, and `'text-domain'` with your specific values.
